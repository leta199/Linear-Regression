# Linear-Regression
Linear regression created from scratch and comparing my implementation to that of the popular packages  scikit -learn. 


## HOW IT'S MADE 

Languages used: Python verion (3.13.2)  
Packages and modules: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn  
Environment: VScode  

## METHOD 
### Data  
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/summary-metrics-by-decile-and-quartile
### Linear regression model

"This is an educational implementation of linear regression for learning purposes — not intended for production use."
## LOOKING TO THE FUTURE  
1) I wish to extend my model to be able to work on all kinds of interatables like pandas series and numpy arrays
2) Add methods to adjust learning rate and number of epochs
3) Add method to show evaluation metrics like R squared, Mean squared error 
4) Add methods to display internal parametrs like the learned weight and bias, residuals and predicted values
5) Display error messages when taking in inputs using the `vectorise()` method
